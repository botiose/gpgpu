* CUDA Bardcode Detector
  This project is an implementation of a barcode detector. The program takes an
  image containing a barcode as input, and it outputs another image highlighting 
  the area in the image in which the barcode was detected.

  There are two implementation off the program, one in C++ and one in CUDA. The
  C++ version served as baseline for the CUDA implementation.
